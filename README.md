We're pleased to announce that the Liquibase Gradle Plugin is now a part of the
Liquibase organization. I'll still maintain the code, it will just live in a
different Git repository. Bringing this project into the larger Liquibase family
will help keep all things Liquibase together in one place and make the project
easier to find for all Liquibase users. The new home for the Liquibase Gradle
Plugin is https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-gradle-plugin

As part of this move, the Liquibase Gradle Plugin is now available through the
official [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.liquibase.gradle).

I'll update existing issues in this repository as they get addressed, but new issues should be reported in the new repository.

Thank you all for your continued support,

Steve Saliman
